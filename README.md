# `ImageMagick_stego`

My first "program" just concatenated bytes at the end of JPEG files to encode and then found the end of the JPEG file and split the bytes to decode.

This is way sillier, it is hardly even able to be called stegonography as you can easily tell that the images contain data and not bitmaps. (Although, computers can't without training.)
